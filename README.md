Pop! Pop! Pop It!

Hey folks!

I am so excited to announce that i have made my first ever browser game based on physics of projectile motion. I cordially invite you to play it on your devices.

Instructions to play:
+ There is a big rounded rectangular box which is our active playing area.
+ There is small circular ball meant to be shoot towards the bubble.
+ The colorful bigger circle is our bubble meant to be popped.
+ There are two variables guiding the projectile motion of the ball, namely the initial velocity and the inclination from ground.
+ Optimize these variables such that the ball pops the bubble.
+ There are two buttons each for launching the the ball and reseting the game.

*Do share the screenshot if you manage to pop any bubble.*
